# DesignPatternsCalculator1

This calculator takes in expressions one-by-one and calculates the answer until the user types "QUIT". It supports add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, number and parenthesis expressions. The calculator takes the expressions in as infix expressions, and converts them into postfix expressions by iterating through the infix expression. While converting, the program uses the abstract factory pattern and command pattern to create instances of expression commands that are then stored in a postfix command array ADT. Meanwhile, numbers in the expression are simply pushed to a stack. Each expression command has an execute() function that corresponds to its type, so when a multiply command has its execute() function called, it pops two numbers off the stack and multiplies them together, then pushes the result onto the stack. An iterator pattern is used to traverse the command array and call execute on each element, which effectively executes the entire expression.
